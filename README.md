# Wireshark-Network-Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to use Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer, to capture and analyze network traffic. By examining real-time packet data, I identified potential security threats, performance issues, and anomalous behavior. This README includes detailed steps, analysis, and screenshots to showcase my skills in network monitoring, packet filtering, and threat detectionâ€”key competencies for a cybersecurity professional.

# Tools Used
- **Wireshark:** Network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting packets.

- **Operating System:** macOS 14

- **Network:** Local Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection for traffic capture.
  
#  Objectives
- Capture live network traffic from my local network.

- Apply filters to isolate specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS).

- Analyze packet details to identify potential security risks (e.g., unencrypted traffic).

- Document findings with screenshots and explanations.

# Step-by-Step Process
# 1. Setup and Installation
  - Downloaded Wireshark from Wireshark's official site.

  - Installed Wireshark on my system following the official instructions for [your OS].

  - Verified administrative/root access to capture packets on my network interface.

# 2. Capturing Network Traffic
  - Launched Wireshark and selected my active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

  - Started packet capture by clicking the "Start" button (shark fin icon).

  - Generated traffic by browsing websites (e.g., http://youtube.com) and performing DNS lookups (e.g., nslookup google.com).

  - Stopped the capture after collecting sufficient data (e.g., 5 minutes of activity).

# 3. Filtering Traffic
Applied a filter to focus on HTTP traffic: http.
- This displayed all HTTP requests and responses in the capture.

- Filtering HTTP traffic to analyze web requests and responses.

Filtered DNS traffic: dns.
- This isolated DNS queries and responses to analyze name resolution activity.

- DNS queries and responses to analyze name resolution activity.


Filtered by IP address: ip.addr == 192.168.1.10 (replace with your device's IP).
This narrowed down traffic to my specific machine.
