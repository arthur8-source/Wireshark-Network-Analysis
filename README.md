# Wireshark-Network-Analysis
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze network traffic using Wireshark to inspect captured packets, detect potential security threats, and understand how network protocols operate. The project includes:

✅ Capturing live network traffic
✅ Filtering and analyzing protocol behavior (TCP, HTTP, DNS, ICMP, etc.)
✅ Identifying potential security threats (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS hijacking)
✅ Using Wireshark for network troubleshooting

This hands-on exercise showcases my expertise in network forensics, security analysis, and troubleshooting techniques.
